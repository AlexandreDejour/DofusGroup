## Presentation

DofusGroup app is a tool to create team players in the game Dofus. This app is a support of my training during my studies in O'Clock School.

## Description

### Problematic

The game [Dofus](https://www.dofus.com/fr) propose many different activities to their players. Many of these activities need to made teams to progress in te game content.

Team building in Dofus is long, hard and boring for multiple facts:

    - No group finder tool integrated
    - Many messages in tchat at the same time
    - Loosing time checking other player caracteristic (level, stuff, knowledge, ...)
    - No preparation
    - Low interest for some of them
  
 All of these, slows down players's progression and deteriorate their experience if they don't find any mate. This situation is accentuated if players don't have many playing time. But now DofusGroup is here to change the game.

### Goal

DofusGroup is here to maximise players's time playing. How it does ? You can early create public event in application with date, hour, tag and other informations. You can invite your friend to the event and DofusGroup's users can join the team if event's author accept them. This feature increase numbers of possible team player dans permit them to win time play. In fact all players know when activity is plan and with who.
