    "title": "About DofusGroup",
    "lead": "DofusGroup is a community platform for creating events around activities in the MMORPG Dofus, allowing players to easily organize themselves into groups."
  },
  "sections": {
    "1": {
      "title": "1. A platform to organize better",
      "p1": "The application allows users, once their account is created, to create events to find players who want to join them.",
      "p2": "Each user can add multiple characters in their profile (representing their in-game avatars) and register them for events available on the platform.",
      "p3": "A comment system attached to each event allows participants to communicate with each other."
    },
    "2": {
      "title": "2. Why DofusGroup?",
      "p1": "Currently, there is no efficient tool addressing this specific need: planning gaming sessions in advance and organizing groups clearly.",
      "p2": "DofusGroup is not designed to instantly find a group, but rather to provide a way to schedule an activity at a given date and time, register in advance, and form a stable group before the gaming session."
    },
    "3": {
      "title": "3. Target audience",
      "p1": "The platform is mainly intended for:",
      "li": [
        "Single-account players dependent on other players to progress.",
        "Guilds wishing to schedule sessions among their members."
      ],
      "p2": "Events can be made private: they are then accessible only via the event's URL.",
      "p3": "The main benefit for the user is better organization and optimization of gaming sessions, without relying on the game's recruitment channel, which is often hard to read."
    },
    "4": {
      "title": "4. Who am I?",
      "p1": "I am a <strong>career-changing developer</strong> and started developing DofusGroup alongside my training. My experience is web-oriented. Much of my learning is self-taught, which allows me to be technically curious and learn new tools quickly.",
      "p2": "I chose Dofus as a starting point because I have been passionate about this universe for nearly 20 years. The project continues the tradition of fan-sites and community tools developed by players over the years.",
      "p3": "What I enjoy most in development: turning a concrete need into a technical solution, working on ergonomics and design, and seeing a project take shape over time."
    },
    "5": {
      "title": "5. In summary",
      "p1": "DofusGroup was born from a mix of passion, learning, and the desire to share. It is a project designed for players, but also highlights my approach as a developer: creating concrete, useful, and accessible tools to improve the user experience."
